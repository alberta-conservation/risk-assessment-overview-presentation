# **The Roadmap:** 

--

## Describing our overall approach 

--

## Risk Assessment vs. 'Prediction' 

--

## From science to decisions

---

# **Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation** 

## The  world has moved on...  

# .center[Species are **Vulnerable** to change]  

## What can we do? 

# .center[We can **Adapt** to this change]  


---
# **Some terms:** 

## **Vulnerability:** *Exposure*, *Sensitivity*, and *Adaptive Capacity* of species or systems to environmental change
<br />
## **Adaptation:** intentional adjustments to natural systems to address bioidiversity risks posed by vulnerability 
<br />

### 4. **Replacement:** new composition and structure
### 5. **Regime shift:** no longer a forest

# The overall goals of the Risk Assessment framework 

## 1. Assess boidiversity risks in terms of vulnerability to landscape and climate change 

## 2. Inform the development of adaptation strategies

# **Responding to RADical Change:** **R**esist-**A**ccept-**D**irect 
### (Lynch et al. 2022; Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment) 

## Identify adaptation pathways based on Ecological, Economic, and Societal feasibility to: 
## - **Resist** ecological transformations (i.e. maintain or restore past conditions)
## - **Accept** coming changes without intervention 
## - **Direct** change to achieve a desired future state
