# **The Roadmap:** 

--

## Describing our overall approach 

--

## Risk Assessment vs. 'Prediction' 

--

## From science to decisions

---

# **Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation** 

## The  world has moved on...  

# .center[Species are **Vulnerable** to change]  

## What can we do? 

# .center[We can **Adapt** to this change]  


---
# **Some terms:** 

## **Vulnerability:** *Exposure*, *Sensitivity*, and *Adaptive Capacity* of species or systems to environmental change
<br />
## **Adaptation:** intentional adjustments to natural systems to address bioidiversity risks posed by vulnerability 
<br />

### 3. **Reassembly:** same structure, new composition
### 4. **Replacement:** new composition and structure
### 5. **Regime shift:** no longer a forest

# The overall goals of the Risk Assessment framework 

## 1. Assess boidiversity risks in terms of vulnerability to landscape and climate change 

## 2. Inform the development of adaptation strategies

```{r reg-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hide", include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# **Forecasting and the Risk Assessment Framework**

# From Forestry to Oil Sands 

## Wildfire and forest harvesting as baselines in landscape simulation models 

- ## Models already published or in development 

## Seismic line recovery models from BERA 

## New grad projects provide fragmentation effects 

---
# Risk Assessment and Structured Decision Making (SDM)

## SDM is a formal process for making decisions under uncertainty 

## Beginning to see greater use in wildlife managemnt 

## Requires active participation of managers and stakehoders throughout the process


---
# Looking Ahead 

## Develop a prototype over the next 6 months 

## Publish methods first, then papers on both ecology and management implications 

## Develop tools for dessemination 

---

# Final thoughts 

## Decisions need to be made under uncertaitny 

## We need to anknowledge and incorporate that uncertianty 

## Risk assessemnt is a powerful tool for accomplishing this goal
